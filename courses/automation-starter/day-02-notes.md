# Automation Starter — Day 02 Notes

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to automation environments
- Lab setup overview
- External service authentication (high level)

## Key Concepts (Beginner View)
- Automation tools often require third-party permissions
- OAuth failures are common during initial setup
- Error messages are part of the workflow, not mistakes

## Lab Outcome
- Lab execution attempted
- Authentication failed due to insufficient permissions
- Error documented for future reference

## What I Don’t Fully Understand Yet
- OAuth provisioning flow in UiPath
- Permission scopes required for Google Sheets integration

## Next Action
- Revisit authentication concepts
- Retry lab after reviewing permission setup
