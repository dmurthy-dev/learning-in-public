# External Contribution — 1Password Kubernetes Operator

**Date:** 2026-01-13  
**Repository:** https://github.com/1Password/onepassword-operator  
**Type:** Documentation improvement  
**Status:** PR closed (issue outdated, maintainer-confirmed)

---

## Summary

Attempted to improve onboarding documentation by adding a direct, canonical link
to the official 1Password Service Accounts documentation in `USAGEGUIDE.md`.

The intent was to reduce friction for users configuring the operator with
Service Accounts by removing an implicit dependency on external knowledge.

---

## Scope of Work

- Reviewed `USAGEGUIDE.md` for missing prerequisite references
- Identified a documentation gap at:
  > “Create a service account”
- Located the canonical documentation source on the 1Password Developer Portal
- Prepared a minimal, style-consistent documentation change

---

## Artifacts & Evidence

## Outcome

- Maintainer confirmed the issue was already resolved upstream

---

## Engineering Judgment Demonstrated

- Correct issue triage

- Respect for maintainer time and project state
- Professional communication and clean exit

---

## Notes

This contribution is considered **successful** from a documentation engineering
perspective, as it validated understanding of repository state, documentation
