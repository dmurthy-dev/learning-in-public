## 🧾 Week 01 Status (Jan 6–12, 2026)

**Outcome:** Foundation established; first external contribution attempted and validated.

### Highlights
- Built a consistent daily logging system (8 consecutive days).
- Identified and documented integration-boundary failures in RPA labs.
- Opened first external documentation PR against a Tier-1 security repository.
- Received maintainer confirmation that the issue was outdated and already resolved upstream.

### External Contribution (Evidence)
- Repository: 1Password/onepassword-operator
- Issue: https://github.com/1Password/onepassword-operator/issues/206
- PR: https://github.com/1Password/onepassword-operator/pull/234
- Commit: d774112
- Outcome: PR closed unmerged (issue outdated; maintainer-confirmed)

**Signal:** Correct issue triage, professional maintainer interaction, and documentation judgment.

---

## ⚠️ Constraints & Assumptions
- Labs and templates may assume cloud ecosystems (OneDrive / Excel Online) different from my setup (Google Workspace).
- Some issues may be outdated due to upstream documentation changes.
- External PRs are attempted only when scope, freshness, and impact are clear.

---

## 🤖 AI Assistance Disclosure
AI tools are used to improve writing clarity and structure.
All technical decisions, commits, error analysis, and maintainer interactions are my own and manually executed.
