# Course-to-Contribution Mapping

This document maps learning activities to observable outputs and
external contribution readiness.

The goal is to avoid “course completion theater” and instead
produce transferable documentation and engineering judgment.

## Mapping Overview

| Learning Area | Course / Source | Output Artifact | Evidence |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Automation basics | Automation Starter | Daily logs | `daily-logs/` |
| Integration failures | Studio Web labs | Error analysis | `assets/day-02`, `assets/day-06` |
| Systems thinking | Dr. Cook lecture | Week 01 review | `weekly-reviews/week-01.md` |
| Documentation judgment | OSS triage | External PR | `contributions/2026-01-13-1password-operator.md` |

## How Courses Feed Contributions

### Automation Starter
- Revealed undocumented integration assumptions
- Exposed connector-specific limitations
- Provided real examples of “work-as-imagined vs work-as-done”

These insights directly informed:
- Issue triage decisions
- Documentation scoping
- Avoidance of redundant PRs

---

## Contribution Readiness Criteria

Before attempting an external PR:
- Issue freshness verified
- Scope limited to documentation only
- Canonical sources identified
- Evidence prepared in advance

Week 01 satisfied all criteria once.

## Long-Term Intent

Courses are not goals.
They are **controlled environments** to surface:
- Assumptions
- Gaps
- Documentation debt
External contributions are the output.
