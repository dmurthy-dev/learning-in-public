# Day 18 — 2026-01-26

**Focus:** Build Your First Process — Prerequisites & Business Scenario  
**Time Spent:** ~2–2.5 hours (theory + guided lab exposure)

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Day

Today’s objective was **not to build or publish an automation**, but to
establish **pre-execution clarity** for the *Build Your First Process with Studio* module.

The focus was on:
- Understanding **mandatory prerequisites**
- Learning how **business requirements translate into automation scope**
- Identifying what must be ready *before* workflow construction begins
- Avoiding execution errors caused by missing setup or unclear process intent

---

## 📘 Course Context

- **Learning Plan:** RPA Developer Foundation (v2021.10)
- **Module:** Build Your First Process with Studio
- **Sections Covered:**
  - Prerequisites
  - Meet the UiPath Studio Interface (partial)
  - Understanding the Business Scenario
- **Execution Status:** Not started (blocked by knowledge check)

---

## 🛠 What I Covered Today

### 1. Prerequisites for the Course

Clarified **non-negotiable setup requirements**:

- **UiPath Studio installed**
  - Required to:
    - Create processes
    - Explore Studio features
    - Complete exercises in later modules
- **Microsoft Office installed**
  - Required for:
    - Outlook-based email activities
    - Email automation scenarios used in this course

Key insight:
> The course assumes these tools are already installed and functional.  
> Missing prerequisites will cause lab failures later.

### 2. Understanding the Business Scenario

Learned how automation work **starts before Studio**:

- Automation begins with understanding the **“as-is” process**
- Typical enterprise flow:
  - Business Analyst documents the process
  - Solution Architect validates feasibility
  - Business signs off on the Process Definition Document (PDD)
- In smaller teams or learning contexts:
  - The **developer performs all three roles**

This course assumes the developer must:
- Analyze the process
- Document steps
- Assess automation potential independently

---

### 3. ACME System 1 (Conceptual Exposure)

- Introduced to **ACME System 1** as the demo application
- Purpose:
  - Simulate a real business system
  - Provide invoices via email
- Emphasis was on:
  - Understanding *what* is automated
  - Not yet *how* it is automated

No execution attempted.

---

## 🧠 Key Observations

- UiPath strongly emphasizes **business-first automation**
- Workflow construction is meaningless without:
  - Approved process steps
  - Clear input/output expectations
- Studio skills are secondary to **process understanding**
- The course intentionally delays execution to prevent blind automation

---

## ⚠️ Constraints & Assumptions

- Knowledge check must be passed before progressing
- Course assumes:
  - Studio is already installed
  - Outlook is available and configured
- Execution steps depend on:
  - Correct platform setup
  - Prior understanding of Orchestrator concepts

---

## 📌 Outcome

- Prerequisites validated conceptually
- Business context for automation clearly understood
- No false execution or progress claimed
- Ready to proceed to:
  - Workflow construction (Part One) **after** clearing the knowledge check
