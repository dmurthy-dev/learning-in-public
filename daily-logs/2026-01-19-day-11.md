# Day 11 — 2026-01-19

**Focus:** RPA Developer Foundation — Platform Theory & Mental Model  
**Time Spent:** ~2–2.5 hours (theory only)

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Day
Day 11 marked the **formal entry into the RPA Developer Foundation learning plan**.

The intent today was **not hands-on automation**, but to:
- Build a correct mental model of the UiPath platform
- Understand how Studio, Robot, and Orchestrator interact
- Identify prerequisites and assumptions *before* execution
- Avoid premature implementation without platform clarity

---

## 📘 Course Context
- **Learning Plan:** RPA Developer Foundation (v2021.10)
- **Current Module:** Explore automation development with UiPath (v2024.10)
- **Nature of Work:** Theory, platform overview, prerequisites
- **Execution Status:** No labs attempted today (by design)

---

## 🛠 What I Covered (Theory Only)

### 1. Automation as a Discipline
- Automation is an umbrella term covering:
  - Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
  - API automation
  - Test automation
  - Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Core definition:
  > If activities inside a machine occur without human intervention, it is automation.

---

### 2. Purpose of the Automation Explorer Path
- Designed for:
  - Beginners entering automation
  - Learners evaluating UiPath as a career path
- Focuses on **foundational understanding**, not production readiness
- Explicitly allows learners to stop after Explorer without penalty

---

### 3. UiPath Core Platform Components
High-level understanding of how the system works:

- **Studio**  
  Designs and builds automation workflows

- **Robot + Assistant**  
  Executes automations (attended / unattended)

- **Orchestrator**  
  Centralized control for:
  - Publishing processes
  - Managing robots and licenses
  - Running jobs
  - Monitoring execution

Key insight:
> Automation in UiPath is a **distributed system**, not a single tool.

---

### 4. Prerequisites & Environment Assumptions
- Requires an **Automation Cloud account** for:
  - Installing Studio, Robot, Assistant
  - License provisioning
  - Job execution
- Version notes:
  - Course originally built on Studio 2022.10
  - Content aligned to 2024.10
  - Visual differences exist, core concepts unchanged

---

### 5. Learning Discipline Emphasized
- Watch theory fully before execution
- Use forums for clarification, not shortcuts
- Treat documentation and release notes as authoritative sources
