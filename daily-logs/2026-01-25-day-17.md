# Day 17 — 2026-01-25

**Focus:** RPA Developer Foundation — Build Your First Process (Theory: Part 1–2)  
**Time Spent:** ~2–2.5 hours (theory only)

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Day

Today was dedicated to **theory-first preparation** for the
**“Build Your First Process with Studio”** module.

The intent was to:
- Understand the **business scenario and expectations**
- Learn the **Studio interface** before execution
- Avoid blind clicking during labs
- Align mental model with **current UiPath platform behavior**

No execution was attempted by design.

## 📘 Course Context

- **Learning Plan:** RPA Developer Foundation (v2021.10)
- **Module:** Build Your First Process with Studio
- **Progress:** Theory covered up to Part 2
- **Execution Status:** Not started (blocked by knowledge check)

---

## 🛠 What I Covered (Theory Only)

### 1. Course Structure & Expectations
- End-to-end walkthrough of a business-driven automation
- Focus on:
  - Understanding requirements
  - Translating them into workflow steps
  - Publishing and running via Orchestrator + Assistant

---

### 2. UiPath Studio Interface (Conceptual)
- Purpose of:
  - Designer panel
  - Activities panel
  - Properties panel
  - Output and debugging areas
- Studio is the **authoring tool**, not the execution engine

---

### 3. Business-First Automation Thinking
- Automation is derived from:
  - Business needs
  - Process steps
  - Data flow
- Not from activities or UI clicks alone

---

## 🧠 Key Observations

- The course assumes:
  - Prior platform clarity (Studio–Robot–Orchestrator)
  - Automation Cloud availability
- Execution steps depend heavily on:
  - Correct role assignments
  - Updated Orchestrator UI
- Older lab videos do not fully reflect the current experience

---

## ⚠️ Constraints & Assumptions

- Knowledge check must be passed before execution
- Lab videos reference older role models
- Studio Web vs Studio Desktop differences are not emphasized inline

---

## 📌 Outcome

- Correct expectations established
- No premature execution attempted
- Reduced risk of repeat confusion seen in earlier labs
