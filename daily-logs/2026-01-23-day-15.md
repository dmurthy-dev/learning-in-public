# Day 15 — 2026-01-23

**Focus:** Clearing Platform Confusion — Publishing & Designing Automations  
**Time Spent:** ~2–2.5 hours (reading + conceptual alignment)

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Day

Today focused on **resolving confusion caused by mismatches between course videos and current UiPath documentation**.

Instead of attempting execution, I intentionally paused to:
- Read **official UiPath documentation**
- Reconcile differences between **older lab videos** and **current platform behavior**
- Build a correct mental model for:
  - Publishing automation projects
  - Designing automations across Windows and cross-platform projects
- Reduce future trial-and-error during labs

## 📘 Sources Studied (Official Docs)

### 1. About Publishing Automation Projects
- UiPath Studio User Guide (Release 2024.10)  
- Last updated: Jan 19, 2026

Key areas reviewed:
- What “publishing” actually means (archiving a project into a package)
- Where projects can be published:
  - Orchestrator (Tenant / Personal Workspace)
  - Assistant (Robot Defaults)
  - Local or custom NuGet feeds
- Differences between:
  - Processes
  - Libraries
  - UI Libraries
  - Templates
  - Test cases
- Versioning, tags, release notes, and icons
- Command-line publishing (`UiPath.Studio.CommandLine.exe`)
- Why **published packages must never be manually unpacked**

### 2. Designing Automations
- UiPath Studio User Guide — Designing Automations (2024.10)

Key concepts clarified:
- Differences between:
  - **Windows projects**
  - **Cross-platform projects**
  - **Windows-Legacy projects**
- Editors and builders:
  - Expression Editor
  - Text Builder
  - Condition Builder
  - Collection Builder
  - Dictionary Builder
- Auto-generated outputs and variables
- Use of **Autopilot™** for expression generation
- Trigger-based automations:
  - Manual triggers
  - Time-based triggers
  - Event-based triggers (unattended robots only)
- Why activity behavior changes based on project compatibility

---

## 🧠 Key Clarifications Gained

- Publishing is **not execution** — it is packaging and distribution
- Orchestrator acts as a **control plane**, not a build tool
- Studio Web and Studio Desktop overlap, but are **not equivalent**
- Many course videos reference:
  - Deprecated roles (e.g., Robot role)
  - Older Orchestrator UI flows
- New tenants use **Automation User–based role models**
- Automation design is highly dependent on:
  - Project compatibility
  - Activity type
  - Execution target (attended vs unattended)

---

## ⚠️ Current Friction / Confusion Areas

- Lab videos demonstrate **legacy role assignment flows**
- New Orchestrator UI makes license + role mapping non-obvious
- Studio Web vs Studio Desktop expectations are not clearly separated
- Beginners are expected to infer platform differences without explicit guidance

This explains earlier confusion during the **“Run your first process”** lab.

---

## 📌 Outcome

- Conceptual clarity restored
- No false execution attempted
- Ready to:
  - Re-attempt execution with correct expectations
  - Capture screenshots of the **new Orchestrator UI**
  - Document gaps between video labs and current platform behavior
