# Day 13 — 2026-01-23

**Focus:** Clearing Platform Confusion — Publishing & Designing Automations  
**Time Spent:** ~2–2.5 hours (reading + conceptual alignment)

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Day

Today was focused on **resolving confusion caused by mismatches between course videos and current UiPath documentation**.

Instead of attempting execution, I intentionally paused to:
- Read **official UiPath documentation**
- Reconcile differences between **old lab videos** and **current platform behavior**
- Build a correct mental model for:
  - Publishing automation projects
  - Designing automations across Windows / Cross-platform projects
- Reduce future trial-and-error during labs
