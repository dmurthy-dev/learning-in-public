# Day 02 — 2026-01-07

**Focus:** Automation Starter setup & first lab execution  
**Time spent:** ~1.5–2 hours

## What I did today
- Continued the **Automation Starter** course from UiPath Academy.
- Attempted the initial lab setup and execution.
- Encountered an authentication error while integrating with Google Sheets.
- Captured and documented the exact error message for future reference.

## Issue encountered
While setting up the lab, I faced the following error during execution:

{
"title": "failure.details",
"provider": {
"endpoint": "GET https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/about
",
"statusCode": "403 (Forbidden)",
"errorMessage": "Insufficient Permission. Please provide consent during OAuth provisioning."
},
"uipath": {
"requestId": "3943735104410701774",
"statusCode": "Forbidden",
"errorMessage": "Failed to authenticate with Google Sheets during provisioning."
}
}


This appears to be related to OAuth permission configuration during third-party service integration.

## Why this matters
- Automation workflows often fail at **integration and permission boundaries**, especially during initial setup.
- Documenting setup failures is as valuable as documenting successful runs.
- Capturing raw error messages helps future debugging and supports reproducibility.

## Learnings
- OAuth-based integrations require explicit permission scopes and consent.
- Initial automation labs are as much about environment setup as logic building.
- Clear error documentation reduces repeated trial-and-error later.

## What I don’t fully understand yet
- The complete OAuth provisioning flow used by UiPath.
- Which permission scopes are mandatory for Google Sheets integration.

## Next steps
- Add structured notes summarizing Day 02 concepts.
- Review UiPath documentation on OAuth and external service authentication.
- Retry the lab after validating permissions.
