# Day 02 — 2026-01-07
**Focus:** Automation Starter lab execution (initial attempt) 
**Time spent:** ~1.5–2 hours
--- 
## What I did today 
- Continued the **Automation Starter** course from UiPath Academy.
- Attempted the first hands-on lab involving Google Sheets integration.
- Encountered an authentication failure during the provisioning step.
- Captured and preserved the exact error output for investigation.
---
## Topics covered 
- Automation environments (Studio Web overview)
- Lab setup and execution flow
- External service authentication (OAuth, high-level)
---
## Issue encountered (blocker) 
During lab execution, the workflow failed while provisioning Google Sheets access.

```json
{
  "title": "failure.details",
  "provider": {
    "endpoint": "GET https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/about",
    "statusCode": "403 (Forbidden)",
    "errorMessage": "Insufficient Permission. Please provide consent during OAuth provisioning."
  },
  "uipath": {
    "requestId": "3943735104410701774",
    "statusCode": "Forbidden",
    "errorMessage": "Failed to authenticate with Google Sheets during provisioning."
  }
}
```  
> At this stage, the error appeared to indicate an OAuth permission or consent issue. No successful execution was achieved on Day 02.
## Initial observations
- The error occurred at an external integration boundary (Google Sheets).
- HTTP 403 suggested a permission-related failure.
- Further diagnosis was deferred to avoid speculative changes.
## Evidence
- Raw error capture: commit 29ef310, lines 06-19
