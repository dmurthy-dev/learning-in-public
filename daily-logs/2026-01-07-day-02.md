# Day 02 — 2026-01-07
Time Taken: ~1.5 - 2 hours
> Time taken includes the time for theory, watching videos and the simple lab set up and execution.

For me while setting up the lab, I have got the below error:
{
  "title": "failure.details",
  "provider": {
    "endpoint": "GET https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/about",
    "statusCode": "403 (Forbidden)",
    "errorMessage": "error - Insufficient Permission. Please provide the <drive scope> during oauth provisioning consent screen"
  },
  "uipath": {
    "requestId": "3943735104410701774",
    "statusCode": "Forbidden",
    "errorMessage": "Failed to authenticate with Google Sheets during provisioning. Please check your credentials or instance configuration"
  }
}

## Reflection
This session reinforced that automation work often fails at integration boundaries.
Documenting setup issues is as important as documenting successful runs.

## Next Step
Add structured notes for Day 02 and continue with remaining Automation Starter modules.
