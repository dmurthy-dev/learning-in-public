# 2026-01-27 → 2026-01-31 — Planned Reset & Cognitive Recovery Window

**Status:** Intentional pause  
**Reason:** Cognitive overload, burnout symptoms, and competing academic + personal obligations

---

## Context

During this window, I experienced:
- Severe mental fatigue and reduced concentration
- Physical symptoms (headaches, mental resistance to study)
- High external pressure from:
  - Job applications and online assessments
  - Mandatory college requirements (assignments, seminars, NPTEL)
  - Paid industrial training obligations
  - Ongoing academic deadlines (4-2 semester)

Continuing forced “daily productivity” during this state would have
produced **superficial work with no learning value** and long-term harm.

---

## Decision Taken

I intentionally paused structured learning and execution from
**Jan 27 to Jan 31, 2026** to:

- Prevent burnout escalation
- Avoid fake or misleading progress logs
- Preserve long-term learning capacity
- Re-center cognitively before resuming execution-heavy work

This pause is **planned, documented, and bounded**.

---

## What Was Done (Low-Load Only)

- Managed personal and academic obligations
- Light, non-committal exposure to learning material (optional, audit-only)
- No labs, no submissions, no execution claims
- No progress misrepresentation

---

## Why This Matters

In professional engineering environments:
- Burnout is treated as a **system risk**
- Pausing is preferable to producing unreliable output
- Honest documentation is valued over constant activity

This reset window is part of maintaining long-term effectiveness.

---

## Next Planned Action

Resume structured work **after Jan 31, 2026** with:
- Reduced scope
- Fewer simultaneous tracks
- Execution only after mental stability is restored

---

## Integrity Note

No learning outcomes are claimed for this period.
This log exists to maintain continuity and transparency.
