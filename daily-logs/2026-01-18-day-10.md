## 🎯 Purpose of the Day
Day 10 marked the **formal completion phase** of the Automation Starter course.
The intent was not speed, but to:

- Understand **Agentic Automation** conceptually (not operationally)
- Distinguish between **rule-based automation**, **specialized AI**, **generative AI**, and **agentic systems**
- Extract **prompt-engineering principles** that transfer beyond UiPath
- Identify risks, assumptions, and governance concerns early
