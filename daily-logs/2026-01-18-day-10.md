# Day 10 — 2026-01-18

**Focus:** Completing Automation Starter · Agentic Automation & Prompt Discipline  
**Time Spent:** ~3–4 hours

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Day
Day 10 marked the **formal completion phase** of the Automation Starter course.
The intent was not speed, but to:

- Understand **Agentic Automation** conceptually (not operationally)
- Distinguish between **rule-based automation**, **specialized AI**, **generative AI**, and **agentic systems**
- Extract **prompt-engineering principles** that transfer beyond UiPath
- Identify risks, assumptions, and governance concerns early

## 🛠 What I Worked On

### 1. Introduction to Agentic Automation
Covered concepts and framing rather than implementation details:
- What agentic automation is *and is not*
- Why agentic systems do **not** start from zero
- How agents integrate into **existing workflows**, not replace them
- Definition of **agentic orchestration** (humans remain accountable)

### 2. Concerns Around Agentic Automation
Reviewed and reflected on:
- Accountability (humans define boundaries and escalation)
- Data security (inherits existing RPA security model)
- Bias and correctness (mitigated through **context grounding**)
- Misconception that agents operate independently without oversight

### 3. Prompt Engineering Fundamentals
Studied structured prompt design, including:
- Specificity vs vagueness
- Providing explicit context
- Defining tone, audience, and depth
- Using step-by-step instructions
- Specifying output format
- Assigning a role or point of view
