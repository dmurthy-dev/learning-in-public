# Day 22 — 2026-02-20  
Focus: Studio Interface Validation & Package Dependency Debugging  
Time Spent: ~4.5 hours  

## 🎯 Objective  

Resume hands-on execution after academic hold and validate the Studio environment against RPA Developer Foundation course expectations.

---

## 🛠 Execution Performed  

- Created new Windows-compatible project: **StudioInterface**
- Verified installed dependencies (.NET Windows profile)
- Located interface differences between course version (2021.10) and Studio 25.x
- Confirmed that the former **Project Panel** is now labeled **Explorer**
- Added **Log Message** activity to `Main.xaml`
- Triggered validation error due to missing required `Message` argument
- Attempted to install `UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities` package

---

## 🚨 Issues Encountered  

### 1️⃣ Package Installation Failure  

- Package: `UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities 25.10.8`
- Error: *Task was canceled*
- Source: Azure DevOps feed
- Multiple retry attempts resulted in same cancellation error

### 2️⃣ Validation Error  

- Required argument `Message` not supplied
- Confirmed activity-level validation behavior in modern profile

---

## 🔍 Technical Analysis  

- Studio version: Windows (.NET modern compatibility)
- Explorer panel replaces historical Project panel naming
- UIAutomation package failure likely due to:
  - Feed connectivity interruption
  - NuGet source misconfiguration
  - Firewall or network timeout

Environment not yet execution-stable for UI automation labs.

---

## 🔄 Next Steps  

- Inspect and validate package sources configuration
- Attempt manual installation via Manage Packages
- Confirm internet connectivity to official UiPath feed
- Execute minimal debug run after resolving package dependency
