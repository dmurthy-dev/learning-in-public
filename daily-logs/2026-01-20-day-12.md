# Day 12 — 2026-01-20

**Focus:** RPA Developer Foundation — Build Your First Process (Guided Execution)  
**Time Spent:** ~2–2.5 hours

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Day
Day 12 marked the **first guided execution phase** of the RPA Developer Foundation path.

The intent today was:
- To understand the **UiPath Studio interface**
- To translate a **business scenario** into automation steps
- To observe how UiPath structures workflows before writing logic
- To proceed slowly and avoid blind execution

---

## 📘 Course Context
- **Learning Plan:** RPA Developer Foundation (v2021.10)
- **Module:** Build Your First Process with Studio
- **Nature of Work:** Guided walkthrough (partial execution)
- **Execution Status:** Studio exploration + workflow understanding

---

## 🛠 What I Did

### 1. Explored UiPath Studio Interface
- Identified key panels:
  - Activities
  - Designer
  - Properties
  - Output
- Observed that Studio enforces **visual structure before logic**

---

### 2. Reviewed the Business Scenario (ACME System 1)
- Understood the automation goal at a **process level**, not task level
- Identified inputs:
  - Emails
  - Attachments
  - Excel files
- Identified outputs:
  - Updated Excel
  - Draft email

---

### 3. Observed Workflow Construction Pattern
- UiPath promotes:
  - Sequential clarity
  - Explicit data flow
  - Separation of concerns
- Workflow design is guided, not free-form

---

## 🧠 Key Observations
- UiPath Studio enforces structure early to reduce runtime ambiguity
- Business understanding precedes activity selection
- The course assumes familiarity with:
  - Email systems
  - Excel concepts
  - Basic UI interaction

---

## ⚠️ Constraints & Assumptions
- Course assumes:
  - Outlook availability
  - ACME System accessibility
- Does not clearly warn about:
  - Non-Outlook email setups
  - Enterprise environment differences
- These assumptions will require validation during labs

---

## 📌 Outcome
- Studio interface mental model established
- Business-to-automation mapping understood
- No premature claims of completion
- Ready for controlled, step-by-step workflow building
