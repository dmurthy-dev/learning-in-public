## Topics explored (high level)
- What are **Triggers**?
- Use of Use Application/Browser activity
- Faced constraint when adding manual trigger i.e, add activity: Use Application/Browser activity.
- To solve it upload open the downloaded .xlsx in Google Sheets and save it your permission given workspace as a Google Sheet.
- UiPath's Google Sheets activities support Google Sheets files only
- What are Target and Anchor?

When automating a web or desktop app, the robot needs to know where to click, type, or get data. That’s where Target and Anchor come in.

How to use UiPath Autopilot

Duration: 25 min

What you'll learn in this lesson

At the end of this lesson you should be able to:

1
Create a project using Autopilot to automate tasks.

2
Write prompts that generate the desired output.

3
Use Autopilot for generating expressions on natural language prompts.

4
Identify and apply best practices for providing instructions and leveraging Autopilot suggestions.

What is Autopilot?

Autopilot is a feature that uses generative AI and natural language processing to automatically create workflows, generate expressions based on descriptions, and help build automations.

Why is it useful

The following features make Autopilot incredibly useful:

Text-to-Workflow: You can simply describe an automation idea in everyday terms, and Autopilot will create the initial workflow. 
Text-to-Expressions: With Autopilot, you don't need to remember the exact syntax and structure of expressions, like Excel and Google Sheets formulas. You can simply describe what you need in plain, everyday language, and the AI will generate the correct expression. 
These features save time and effort, making it easier to build, edit, and optimize automation projects without requiring deep technical knowledge.

Use case

A consumer electronics company offers extended warranties on products — but only if customers register them using a unique Product Registration Code (PRC). These codes are issued on physical packaging and must be submitted through a registration form or by email.

Challenge:
Customers often submit codes in the wrong format, mistyped, or incomplete. This leads to delays, back-and-forth communication, and missed warranty activations.

Goal:
Automate the validation of registration codes to ensure:

Only properly formatted codes are processed.

Customers with invalid codes are immediately notified with clear correction instructions.

Internal teams save time by automating repetitive validation and communication steps.


What do I need to get started?


Upload this spreadsheet to your preferred folder (for Microsoft 365 users)

customer_codes_with_emails.xlsx
8.6 KB

Copy this file(opens in a new tab) to your Google Drive (for Google Workspace users)


Microsoft 365 prompt:

Read an Excel file, which contains columns: "Customer Name", "Code Submitted", and "Email Address".

For each row in the spreadsheet:

Validate the value in "Code Submitted" using this rule:
The code must start with PRD-, followed by 4 digits, and end with 2 uppercase letters (e.g., PRD-1234AB).
If the code matches this format, consider it Valid. Otherwise, it's Invalid.

If the code is Valid, send an email to the address in "Email Address" with the subject "Registration Successful" and body:
"Hello [Customer Name], your product registration code '[Code Submitted]' has been successfully verified. Thank you!"

If the code is Invalid, send an email with the subject "Action Needed: Invalid Code" and body:
"Hello [Customer Name], the code '[Code Submitted]' you provided is invalid. Please double-check the format and try again. Valid format: PRD-1234AB."


Google Workspace prompt:

Read a Google Workbook file, which contains columns: "Customer Name", "Code Submitted", and "Email Address".

For each row in the workbook:

Validate the value in "Code Submitted" using this rule:
The code must start with PRD-, followed by 4 digits, and end with 2 uppercase letters (e.g., PRD-1234AB).
If the code matches this format, consider it Valid. Otherwise, it's Invalid.

If the code is Valid, send an email to the address in "Email Address" with the subject "Registration Successful" and body:
"Hello [Customer Name], your product registration code '[Code Submitted]' has been successfully verified. Thank you!"

If the code is Invalid, send an email with the subject "Action Needed: Invalid Code" and body:
"Hello [Customer Name], the code '[Code Submitted]' you provided is invalid. Please double-check the format and try again. Valid format: PRD-1234AB."

9.3 MB
Let's unpack a few key concepts covered by the guide:


Creating a workflow using Autopilot
To get started, click "Generate with Autopilot" next to the search box on the Templates page. You can also pick the Autopilot card from the Templates or choose "Generate with Autopilot" from the dropdown by "New project" on the Automations page.
In the "Generate with Autopilot" window, type out what you want to do using everyday language, or pick a predefined example to get going.
Autopilot will suggest activity categories based on the keywords it picks up from your instructions.
Hit the "Generate" button to see a preview of your workflow.
If it's not quite right, tweak your instructions and try again to get a new preview.
Once you're happy with it, click "Continue" to turn it into a full-blown automation project in Studio Web.

Generating expressions using Autopilot
Use the "Generate expression" box in the Expression Editor to describe what you want to happen in plain language.
The AI will generates an expression based on your description, and you can either modify it or go with it as-is.
If there is an error, click "Fix," and Autopilot will try to sort it out for you.

Adding activities using Autopilot
Click the plus sign to add an activity. Describe what you want to do next in the search bar, then select "Generate with Autopilot"
Autopilot will create a new sequence based on your instructions, which you can save or hit "Generate" to see it in action.
Check out the workflow preview and tweak or approve it as needed.

## Key takeaways 
- Triggers
A trigger is what starts an automation. It’s the event or condition that kicks off your workflow, and every project includes one trigger as the first activity in the main workflow. You select the trigger when creating a new project—templates usually come with one pre-configured.

Types of triggers in Studio Web
Manual trigger (default)
The automation starts only when you run it yourself. Great for testing or ad-hoc use.

Scheduled trigger
The automation runs at specific times—perfect for routine tasks like daily reports or weekly file uploads.

Event-based trigger
The automation starts when something happens, such as receiving an email or a file being added to a folder.

After creating your project, you can configure the trigger so it starts exactly when needed—by setting a time, defining a recurrence pattern, or applying filters to event-based triggers.


Nesting
Nesting activities means placing one activity inside another to create more structured and manageable workflows.

You can group related steps into sequences to keep things organized and efficient. Some activities in UiPath Studio Web are like containers. They limit what can happen or control how and when the activities inside them are done.

These container activities are essential for adding logic and structure to your automation. Here are a few key examples:

Common container activities
Use Browser
Attaches to a specific browser page and runs all nested UI automation activities within that page’s context.

If
Evaluates a condition and determines which set of nested activities to run—based on whether the condition is true or false.

For Each
Loops through a collection of items and runs the nested activities once per item in the list.

Nesting not only helps you manage complexity—it also ensures your automation behaves correctly based on conditions, input, and scope.


Input/output
Understanding inputs and outputs is key to building effective automations:

An input is data received by an application through an activity.

An output is data generated by an activity and sent back to an application.

For example, in the Unicorn Name exercise:

Inputs included the typed name and selected birth month.

The output was the generated Unicorn Name, which was stored in a variable and written back to a spreadsheet.

How inputs work
Inputs can come from different sources, such as:

Manually entered during project design (e.g., static values).

Pulled from external files or applications during runtime.

Handling outputs
After processing the inputs, automations often need to store or use the resulting data. In Studio Web, you can store output data:

In variables

In spreadsheets

In files or connected apps

Choosing the right output method depends on what the automation needs to do next.


Passing values between activities
Variables capture the output of one activity and let you reuse it later across your workflow.

In Studio Web, most output variables are created automatically, simplifying the process. If you need to create a custom variable, you can do so from the Data Manager or via the See more menu next to input fields.

Note: Variables generated within a scope activity—like Use Browser—can only be used within that specific scope.

Using variables
To insert a variable:

Click See more → Use Variable next to an input field, or

Click directly on fields labeled Click to use a variable.

You can also use variables in editors like Text Builder and Rich Text Composer.

Finding the right variable
Automatically generated variables appear under their respective activities in the variable picker. You can:

Scroll through the list, or

Use the search bar to quickly locate the one you need.

Some variables display common properties at the top. To view more details, click Show more.

Variable types
Not all variables are compatible with all fields—this depends on data types. Icons next to each variable help you identify them:

Tt for text

123 for whole numbers

1.2 for decimals


Targets and anchors
When automating a web or desktop app, the robot needs to know where to click, type, or get data. That’s where Target and Anchor come in.

Target tells the robot what element to interact with (like a button, field, or label).

Anchor helps the robot find the right place by using a nearby, steady thing. It's especially useful when the target moves or looks like others.


Iterations
Iteration means repeating a set of activities for each item in a collection—like a list of emails, rows, or files.

To iterate in Studio Web, use the For Each activity:

Add the For Each activity to your workflow.

Define the collection to loop through.

Add the actions you want to repeat inside the activity.

Use the current item variable to reference each item during the loop.

Types of For Each activities
Studio Web includes a generic For Each (under the Control category), as well as specialized versions tailored for specific data types:

For Each Email (Microsoft 365 & Google Workspace)
Repeats actions for every email in a folder.
→ Current item: CurrentEmail

For Each File/Folder
Repeats actions for each file or folder in OneDrive or SharePoint.
→ Current item: CurrentItem

For Each Row in Workbook / Spreadsheet
Loops through each row in Excel or Google Sheets.
→ Current item: CurrentRow

For Each Sheet in Workbook / Spreadsheet
Repeats actions for every sheet in an Excel workbook or Google spreadsheet.
→ Current item: CurrentItem

Using the correct For Each activity ensures that your automation runs efficiently and that each step processes the right data.
