# Day 05 — 2026-01-10

**Focus:** UiPath Studio Web fundamentals & Autopilot overview  
**Time spent:** ~2–3.5 hours

---

## What I did today
- Reviewed the **UiPath Studio Web interface** to understand project structure, triggers, and activity layout.
- Revisited the Unicorn Name automation flow from Day 02 to better understand UI context, scope, and data flow.
- Used **Manual Triggers** and **Autopilot-generated workflows** to design and test two small automation labs.
- Reflected on the role of **human verification** when using AI-assisted workflow generation.

---

## Concepts clarified (with hands-on application)
- **Triggers:** How automations are initiated (manual vs generated workflows).
- **Use Application/Browser:** How UI scope containers define execution context and variable visibility.
- **Input vs Output:** How data must be explicitly captured and passed between activities.
- **Variables & scope:** Why variables created inside a scope (e.g., Use Browser) are not accessible outside it.
- **Targets and Anchors:** How UiPath reliably identifies UI elements during automation.

---

## Key observations
- Generative AI features (Autopilot) accelerate workflow creation, but **do not remove the need for human review**.
- Most automation issues arise at **integration and scope boundaries** (files, APIs, authentication).
- Understanding scope and data flow is more critical than adding activities quickly.
- AI-generated workflows should be treated as **draft starting points**, not final implementations.

---

## Relevance to my goals
- Strengthens my foundation in **responsible automation design**.
- Reinforces documentation habits focused on clarity and traceability.
- Aligns with my goal of combining **AI enablement** with **human oversight**.

---

## Notes
- Two small workflows were designed today using a mix of manual configuration and Autopilot-generated steps.
- Detailed course notes, prompts, and screenshots are tracked under the `/courses/automation-starter/` directory.
