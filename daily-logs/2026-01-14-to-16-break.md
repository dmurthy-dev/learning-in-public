# Break Period — January 14–16, 2026

**Context:** Regional festivals  
**Status:** Partial pause from structured daily logs

---

## Why this break exists

January 14–16 are regional festival days.  
During this period, I’m intentionally pausing **formal daily log entries** in this repository to respect personal and cultural commitments.

This is a **planned pause**, not a lapse in engagement.

---

## What continues during the break

Although no new daily logs are added here, I may still:

- Use GitHub for:
  - Reading documentation
  - Reviewing issues and PRs
  - Exploring repositories and contributor guidelines
- Learn or experiment in:
  - Other repositories
  - Scratch / exploratory repos
  - Private notes or drafts
- Set up or restructure repositories for future contributions

These activities are **exploratory and preparatory**, not yet suitable for evidence-backed logging.

---

## What resumes after the break

- Structured daily logs in `learning-in-public`
- Evidence-backed documentation
- External contribution attempts (documentation-first)
- Weekly review continuity

The next formal entry will resume with **clear context and continuity**.

## Professional note

Intentional rest and context switching are part of sustainable engineering practice.  
Pausing visible output is sometimes required to preserve long-term consistency and judgment quality.
