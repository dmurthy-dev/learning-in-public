## 🎯 Purpose of the Day

Today marked the **first structured learning day after the planned reset window (ended Feb 5)**.

The intent was deliberately *lightweight*:
- Resume engagement without forcing execution
- Complete non-technical but required course components
- Rebuild learning momentum without triggering overload

No new automation was built today by design.
