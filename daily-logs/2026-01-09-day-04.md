# Day 04 — 2026-01-09

**Focus:** Planned pause / consolidation  
**Time spent:** 0 hours (no active study or execution)

---

## What I did today
- Took a deliberate break from active coursework and automation labs.
- Did not perform hands-on work, reading, or experimentation.

---

## Why this matters
- Continuous learning without pauses reduces retention and increases shallow understanding.
- A planned rest day helps consolidate concepts from earlier sessions (Days 01–03).
- Logging a zero-activity day maintains honesty and traceability in this learning journal.

---

## Notes
- No updates were made to repositories or course progress today.
- Regular activities will resume on the next scheduled learning day.
