# Academic Hold — 2026-02-08 to 2026-02-19

**Status:** Temporary pause due to college examinations and reviews  
**Reason:** Academic priority and mandatory submissions  
**Execution Work:** None  

## Context

Following environment setup and governance alignment work,
college academic workload intensified beyond expected scope.

Rather than producing artificial commits or fragmented progress,
the learning cycle was intentionally paused.

## Integrity Decision

No:
- Studio execution
- Partial automation attempts
- Simulated progress entries

This preserves learning accuracy and repository credibility.

## Restart Plan

UiPath structured execution will resume on:

**20-02-2026**

Focus will return to:
- RPA Developer Foundation execution labs
- Controlled Studio workflows
- Capstone preparation roadmap alignment
