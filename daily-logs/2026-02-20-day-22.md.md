# Day 22 — 2026-02-20  
Focus: Studio Interface Validation & Dependency Debugging  
Time Spent: ~4.5 hours  

## 🎯 Purpose  

Resume hands-on execution by validating Studio interface alignment and resolving environment configuration issues.

## 🛠 Execution Performed  

- Created new Windows project: "StudioInterface"
- Observed that the former "Project" panel is now labeled "Explorer" in Studio 25.x.
- Added Log Message activity to Main.xaml.
- Identified validation error due to missing required "Message" argument.
- Attempted to install UIAutomation package.

## 🚨 Issues Encountered  

1. Package download failure:
   - UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities 25.10.8
   - Error: Task was canceled (Azure feed interruption)

2. Validation error:
   - Required "Message" argument not supplied.

## 🔍 Analysis  

- Explorer panel replaces old Project panel terminology.
- Studio version is Windows (.NET modern profile).
- Package feed connectivity issue requires resolution before UI automation labs.

## 🔄 Next Actions  

- Verify package sources configuration.
- Reinstall UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities.
- Complete basic Log Message debug execution.
