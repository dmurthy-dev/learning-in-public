## 🎯 The Mission  
To transition from "Passive Learner" to "Active Contributor" by addressing a documentation gap in a Tier-1 security repository.

---

## 🛠️ The Execution
1. **Identified a Gap:**  
   The `USAGEGUIDE.md` contained a step ("Create a service account") without a direct link to the instructions. This represents an *integration boundary* failure—assuming users know where to find prerequisite documentation.

2. **Surgical Strike:**  
   - Located the **canonical source of truth** on the 1Password Developer Portal.
   - Avoided recursive linking back to the operator documentation.
   - Matched existing document structure and tone.

3. **The Artifact:**  
   - **PR:** https://github.com/1Password/onepassword-operator/pull/234  
   - **Issue:** https://github.com/1Password/onepassword-operator/issues/206  

---

## 🧠 Engineering Insight
This change focused on reducing **Time to Value (TTV)** by removing an implicit dependency.
Users no longer need to search externally to understand Service Account creation before configuring the operator.

---

## 📌 Outcome
- PR #234 was closed unmerged because the documentation had already been updated upstream.
- The maintainer confirmed the issue was outdated and thanked me for the contribution attempt.
- This validated correct issue triage, documentation judgment, and professional contribution workflow.

**Result:** Professional interaction completed successfully; no further action required.
