## 🎯 The Mission
To transition from "Passive Learner" to "Active Contributor" by fixing a documentation gap in a Tier-1 security repository.

## 🛠️ The Execution
1.  **Identified a Gap:** The `USAGEGUIDE.md` had a list item ("Create a service account") without a link to the instructions. This is a classic "Integration Boundary" failure—assuming the user knows where to look.
2.  **Surgical Strike:**
    -   Located the **canonical source of truth** (Developer Portal).
    -   Avoided the "recursive link" error (linking back to the operator docs).
    -   Matched the existing document style (bullets/headers).
3.  **The Artifact:**
    -   **PR:** [docs: add service account documentation link to USAGEGUIDE #234](https://github.com/1Password/onepassword-operator/pull/234)
    -   **Issue:** Fixes #206

## 🧠 Engineering Insight
This change reduces onboarding friction by removing an implicit documentation dependency.
Users no longer need to search externally to understand Service Account creation before operator configuration.
