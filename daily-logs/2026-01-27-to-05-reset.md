# 2026-01-27 → 2026-02-05 — Planned Reset & Cognitive Recovery Window

**Status:** Intentional pause (extended)  
**Reason:** Cognitive overload, burnout symptoms, and overlapping academic + personal obligations

---

## Context

During this period, I experienced sustained mental fatigue that impacted:
- Concentration and comprehension
- Physical well-being (headaches, mental resistance)
- Ability to meaningfully engage with execution-heavy learning

This coincided with:
- Multiple job applications and online assessments
- Mandatory college requirements (assignments, seminars, NPTEL)
- Paid industrial training obligations
- 4-2 semester academic pressure

Continuing daily execution during this state would have resulted in
**superficial output with no learning value**.

---

## Decision Taken

The reset window originally planned for Jan 27–31 was **extended to Feb 2, 2026** to allow full cognitive recovery.

The intent of this pause is to:
- Prevent burnout escalation
- Avoid misleading or low-integrity progress logs
- Preserve long-term learning capacity
- Re-enter structured work with clarity rather than force

This pause is **planned, documented, and time-bounded**.

---

## What Was Done (Low-Load Only)

- Addressed personal and academic obligations
- Optional, low-pressure exposure to learning material (audit/read-only)
- No labs, no submissions, no execution claims
- No artificial or filler commits

---

## Why This Matters

In professional engineering environments:
- Burnout is treated as a delivery risk
- Pausing is preferable to producing unreliable output
- Transparency is valued over constant activity

This reset is a **maintenance action**, not a gap.

---

## Next Planned Action

Resume structured work **after Feb 5, 2026**, with:
- Reduced scope
- Fewer parallel tracks
- Execution only after mental stability is restored

---

## Integrity Note

No learning outcomes are claimed for this period.
This log exists solely for continuity and transparency.
