## 🎯 Purpose of the Day

Day 13 focused on **attempting to execute the “Run your first process” flow** from the **Explore automation development with UiPath (v2024.10)** module.

The objective was to:
- Validate whether the course video aligns with the current UiPath Automation Cloud experience
- Identify execution blockers before forcing configuration changes
- Capture evidence where platform behavior diverges from course instructions
- Preserve system integrity by stopping at undocumented boundaries
