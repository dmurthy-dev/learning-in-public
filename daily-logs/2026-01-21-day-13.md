# Day-13 - 2026-01-21

**Focus:** RPA Developer Foundation — Platform Execution Gap & Documentation Drift
**Time Spent:** ~2–2.5 hours (theory + partial execution attempt)

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Day

Day 13 focused on **attempting to execute the “Run your first process” flow** from the **Explore automation development with UiPath (v2024.10)** module.

The objective was to:
- Validate whether the course video aligns with the current UiPath Automation Cloud experience
- Identify execution blockers before forcing configuration changes
- Capture evidence where platform behavior diverges from course instructions
- Preserve system integrity by stopping at undocumented boundaries

---

## 📘 Course Context
- **Learning Plan:** RPA Developer Foundation (v2021.10)
- **Module:** Explore automation development with UiPath (v2024.10)
- **Nature of Work:** Studio–Robot–Orchestrator execution flow
- **Execution Status:** Publish a process to Orchestrator and run it via UiPath Assistant

---

## 🛠 What I Attempted
Following the official course video, I attempted to:
1. Create / access a UiPath Automation Cloud account
2. Navigate to **Orchestrator** → **Tenant** → **Manage Access**
3. Assign execution permissions to a newly invited user
4. Proceed toward publishing and running a first process

Execution halted at Step 3.

## 🚨 Execution Blocker Identified — Platform Drift

### What the Course Video Demonstrates
- Assigning the deprecated Robot role
- Role assignment path:
  ```
  Orchestrator → Tenant → Manage Access → Assign roles → Robot
  ```
- Robot role providing both tenant-level and folder-level permissions

---


## What the Current Platform Enforces (Observed)
- Robot role is no longer available for new tenants
- Access control is now split into:
- Automation User at the tenant level
- Automation User at the folder level
- The UI no longer exposes the assignment flow shown in the video
- This mismatch causes the learner to reach a dead-end when following the video literally.

---


## 🔎 Evidence Captured
- Screenshot:
  - assets/day-13/orchestrator-manage-access-roles.png
- UI state confirms:
  - No Robot role present
- No equivalent “Assign Robot” action
- Course acknowledgment of deprecation appears after demonstrating the obsolete flow

---


## 🧠 Key Observations
- This is not a configuration or user error
- The issue is documentation sequencing, not missing permissions
- New learners are expected to reinterpret role assignment without guidance
- Stopping execution early prevented incorrect role or permission creation

---


## ⚠️ Constraints & Assumptions

- Course assumes:
  - Legacy Robot role availability
- Older Orchestrator access model
- Platform reality:
  - New Automation Cloud tenants use a revised RBAC model
- Course material has not been fully updated to reflect this
- No official step-by-step mapping is provided for the new model in this lesson

---


### 📌 Outcome

- Execution intentionally paused to avoid misconfiguration
- Platform drift documented with evidence
- Clear documentation gap identified for future reference
- Ready to resume execution only after clarifying:
- Correct tenant-level permission
- Correct folder-level permission
- Modern replacement for deprecated Robot role

AI tools were used only to improve writing clarity and structure.
All observations, decisions, screenshots, and execution attempts were performed and verified by me.
