# Day 09 — 2026-01-17

**Focus:** Realignment after break & documentation hygiene  
**Time Spent:** ~1–1.5 hours

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Day
Today marked the transition into **Week 02** after a short break (Jan 14–16).

The primary goal was **not new execution**, but:
- Verifying that Week 01 artifacts are complete, consistent, and evidence-backed
- Correcting omissions, inconsistencies, and weak signals in earlier logs
- Establishing a cleaner daily and commit discipline going forward

---

## 🛠 What I Did
- Reviewed **all daily logs (Day 01–Day 08)** for:
  - Date consistency
  - Scope clarity
  - Alignment with evidence
- Verified that error-related entries have:
  - Raw logs or screenshots
  - Stable file paths under `/assets`
  - Cross-links to the correct daily logs
- Reviewed recent commit patterns to identify where batching reduced clarity
- Decided to move to **section-scoped, single-intent commits** from Week 02 onward

---

## 🧠 Key Observations
- Batch commits were acceptable during initial setup (Week 01) but reduce traceability once structure stabilizes
- Daily logs should reflect **intent and outcome**, not internal confusion
- Evidence-first documentation significantly reduces the need for retrospective explanations

---

## 📌 Outcome
- Week 01 is now structurally sound and verifiable
- Day 09 serves as a **reset point**, not a productivity metric
- A clearer operating model for commits and daily logs is now in place

---

## ⏭ Next Step (Day 10)
- Resume execution with:
  - Smaller, well-scoped changes
  - One idea → one edit → one commit
  - Daily logs written *after* work is complete, not during
