# Day 01 — 2026-01-06

**Focus:** Project setup & learning system initialization  
**Time spent:** ~1.5–2 hours

## What I did today
- Set up core GitHub repositories for my 60-day documentation journey.
- Defined a clear structure for learning-in-public, daily logs, and course mapping.
- Aligned repository goals with ethical, verifiable open-source contribution standards.

## Why this matters
This setup ensures that all future learning and contributions are:
- Transparent
- Traceable
- Grounded in real work (no placeholder or fake activity)

## Learnings
- Clarity in structure reduces friction and decision fatigue.
- Separating learning logs from contribution records helps maintain honesty.

## Next steps
- Start **Automation Starter – Introduction to Automation** module.
- Document the first learning note in `uipath-rpa-learning`.
- Identify one documentation page to read and observe for clarity gaps.
