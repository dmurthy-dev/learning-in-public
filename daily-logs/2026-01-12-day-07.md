# Day 07 — 2026-01-12

**Focus:** Why systems fail — reframing how I interpret errors  
**Time spent:** ~1 hour

---

## What I did today
- Watched **“How Complex Systems Fail”** by **Dr. Richard I. Cook**.
  - Source: https://youtu.be/2S0k12uZR14
- Revisited the errors encountered on Day 02 and Day 06 from a systems-thinking perspective, focusing on *why* they occurred rather than *how* to patch them.

---

## Core ideas explored
- Complex systems do not fail because of a single mistake; failures emerge from **interactions between components**, assumptions, and constraints.
- Systems often appear deterministic on paper but behave unpredictably in real environments.
- Human operators (including developers) routinely adapt systems beyond their original design intent.

---

## Why this matters to my work
This reframed how I interpret the automation issues I encountered earlier:

- The OAuth and file-handling errors were not isolated bugs, but **boundary failures** between tools, connectors, and assumptions.
- Studio Web templates assume specific cloud ecosystems (OneDrive + Excel Online). Using Google Workspace introduced *latent mismatches* that only surfaced at runtime.
- The errors were not evidence of misuse, but of **implicit design assumptions becoming visible**.

This explains why:
- Templates can be logically correct yet operationally fragile.
- Documentation must clearly state environmental constraints.
- Debugging often requires examining context and workflow design, not just error messages.

---

## Key takeaways
- Errors are signals of system boundaries, not personal failure.
- Understanding *how systems fail* improves decision-making before implementation.
- Treating templates as reference designs—not guarantees—reduces risk and frustration.
- Clear documentation of assumptions and constraints is as important as code or automation logic.

## Reflection
Today was intentionally non-execution focused.  
The goal was to improve judgment and reasoning before proceeding with further labs, weekly review synthesis, and potential open-source contributions.

This perspective will directly inform how I:
- Document errors and constraints
- Write future learning logs
- Approach template-based automations
